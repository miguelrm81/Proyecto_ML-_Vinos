Founded in 1880 by Domingo Fernandez in Chile’s Maipo Valley, this historic property was among the first to pioneer plantings of European grape varieties in Chile. In 1980, it was acquired by its present owner, Gruppo Claro, under whom Santa Rita has reaped the rewards of continuous investment, resulting in a period of impressive growth, during which the winery has consolidated its position in the vanguard of Chile’s most successful and innovative estates.    Santa Rita’s internationally popular, best-selling “120” Series of varietal wines recalls the heroes of a pivotal event in Chile’s successful 19th century struggle to overthrow Spanish rule. History relates that in the early 1800s Doña Paula Jaraquemada, then proprietor of the Santa Rita manor house and estate near the Chilean capital of Santiago, famously gave refuge in the cellars of her property to 120 Chilean patriots. When a brigade of Spanish soldiers arrived at the expansive one-story ranch house in search the band of rebels, the feisty matriarch stated she would rather see the Spanish burn the property to the ground, with her inside, then let them step foot within her family home. Thus it was that band of 120 men lived on to fight another day, and the dwelling, now site of Santa Rita’s highly acclaimed Doña Paula Restaurant, occupies a unique place in Chilean national history."

Considered by many to still be the region's best kept secret, The Cigar is a truly delightful Cabernet Sauvignon with lifted violet and blackcurrant aromas with a balanced note of cedar and tobacco. Known to many as the 'Baby Menzies', the Cigar is a brilliant modern take on Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon and has always shown a propensity to sell out quickly each vintage.    Fruit sourced from the Menzies vineyard    •Several important critics have rated this Coonawarra wine highly: Wine Spectator gave the 2011 vintage a score of 91.  •Numerous prizes have been won by this wine: the Decanter World Wine Awards awarded the 2010 Silver and the Dallas Wine Competition awarded the 2009 vintage Silver.  •This is one of the most popular wines from the region (with Wine-Searcher users). Interest in this wine is less pronounced than in previous years.    Cabernet Sauvignon is probably the most famous red wine grape variety on Earth. It is rivaled in this regard only by its Bordeaux stablemate Merlot, and its opposite number in Burgundy, Pinot Noir. From its origins in Bordeaux, Cabernet has successfully spread to almost every wine-growing country in the world. It is now the key grape variety in many first-rate New World wine regions, most notably Napa Valley, Coonawarra and Maipo Valley. Wherever they come from, Cabernet Sauvignon wines always seem to demonstrate a handful of common character traits; deep color, good tannin structure, moderate acidity and aromas of blackcurrant, tomato leaf, dark spices and cedarwood.    Used as frequently in blends as in varietal wines, Cabernet Sauvignon has a large number of common blending partners. Apart from the obvious Merlot and Cabernet Franc, the most prevalent of these are Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere (the ingredients of a classic Bordeaux Blend), Syrah/Shiraz (in Australia) and Tempranillo (in Spain and South America). Even the bold Tannat-based wines of Madiran are now generally softened with Cabernet Sauvignon.    DNA profiling carried out in California in 1997 confirmed that Cabernet Sauvignon is the product of a natural genetic crossing between key Bordeaux grape varieties Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc. Most wine authorities agree that this crossing happened only within the past few centuries, making the variety's global fame and dominance all the more impressive. (© Wine-Searcher)"

HOW IT'S MADE
Upon entering the winery, the hand-harvested grapes are sorted, destemmed and then cold soaked for three days. Following the cold soak, yeast is added and pump overs commence, one to two times daily, for the duration of primary fermentation. The wine is drained and pressed, then moved to barrels for malolactic fermentation, remaining in individual lots until blending and bottling. The wine completes a total of 16 months barrel aging, allowing for the perfect balance of fruit, tannin and oak."

Vineyard
The grapes for our 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserva come from our vineyards located in the Maipo and Aconcagua valleys. The Maipo Valley is known for the fresh morning breezes that blow from the mountains, and for the moderate day temperatures that allow the grapes to reach perfect ripeness preserving their acidity and freshness. One of the main factors that allow obtaining intense colours in the wines from this area is the large temperature oscillation. The alluvial soils are moderately fertile and have a stony profile that provides excellent drainage, producing a perfect balance of vegetative growth and fruit load. The Aconcagua Valley, on the other hand, is well known for its Mediterranean climate, with moderately warm summer days and fresh evening breezes, producing a daily temperature oscillation of around 20ºC in the weeks prior to harvest. This triggers high concentrations of polyphenols –anthocyanins- creating wines with great colour intensity. The soils of the vineyard are mainly of alluvial origin, formed by the Aconcagua River, and are generally well known for their good drainage"

From its origins in Bordeaux, Cabernet has successfully spread to almost every wine-growing country in the world. It is now the key grape variety in many first-rate New World wine regions, most notably Napa Valley, Coonawarra and Maipo Valley. Wherever they come from, Cabernet Sauvignon wines always seem to demonstrate a handful of common character traits; deep color, good tannin structure, moderate acidity and aromas of blackcurrant, tomato leaf, dark spices and cedarwood."

For five centuries and seventeen generations, the Planeta family has been involved in Sicilian agriculture. Their work on the island has contributed to the revitalization of Sicilian winemaking, now one of the most dynamic and sought-after viticultural regions in the world. Planeta’s journey begins at Sambuca di Sicilia, on the estate owned by the family since the 1600s. Here on Italy's most enchanting island, three enthusiastic young Sicilians, Alessio, Francesca and Santi Planeta, under the guidance of Diego Planeta, began their winemaking venture in the mid-1980s. Subsequent years were spent matching the extraordinarily diverse Sicilian soils with both indigenous and international varieties. Years of careful research paid off when the Planeta wines were met with immediate critical acclaim upon introduction in the U.S. in the late 1990s.

The Livermore Valley is the perfect climate for growing world-class wine grapes. Forty-degree temperature swings daily during the growing season allow for longer hang time as the grapes mature during the warmer, sunny days, yet slow down and maintain their acidity during the cool, breezy nights. This not only creates lower yield, higher concentrated berries, but allows for full development of sugar, adding complexity to the grapes, as well as producing bright, bold fruit flavors in the wine.    From our Livermore Valley vineyards, our portfolio of wines includes traditional Bordeaux inspired red blends of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Crown Block Vineyard; Award winning Chardonnays and a field-blend of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah from the Hoffman/DeMayo Vineyard; Merlot from the Picazo Vineyard; and Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Syrah from the Madden Ranch vineyard.

Those cabernet vines—now over sixty-five years old—produced the first Ridge Monte Bello (1962) and subsequent vintages until 1974. By then other abandoned blocks had been replanted and their fruit considered for use in the Monte Bello. A number of those consistently produced a more accessible wine that developed its full complexity earlier and these were combined as the “Santa Cruz Mountains.” With the 2008 vintage the name of this stylistically distinct wine became the Ridge Estate Cabernet Sauvignon, stressing the principal varietal and the Monte Bello estate vineyard as its source."

By 1985, the old vines were producing less then a half-ton per acre and were taken out. The younger vines, planted in the ‘70s, provide the majority of grapes today. Initially these newer plantings were on the “lower” vineyard—not yet farmed as part of the Monte Bello estate—so the wine was called “Santa Cruz Mountains” and these vines have long since been included.

With a surface area under vine of 229 hectares, the vineyards situated at 1,200 meters above sea level on the Andean foothills were the first ever to be planted in Vista Flores, Uco valley, in 1998. The grapes used in its Mendocinean wines are all sourced from its own vineyards and bear the distinctive characteristics of high-altitude, continental-climate wines. Finca el Origen's signature varieties are Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Torrontés.

The grapes for this incredible single vineyard wine come from our genuine estate La Esperanza, located in Vista Flores, Uco Valley, at the foothills of the Andes mountain range (1 200 m./3 900 ft.a.s.l.). The medium to low fertility soils are very permeable and well drained. Due to the altitude, there is a wide thermal amplitude between day and night. The vineyards are naturally healthy, due to the warm, dry breezes that blow throughout the spring and summer. Vista Flores is nowadays considered one of the best terroirs for our emblematic variety. 

Grapes were harvested during the cool temperatures of the night and the early morning, allowing a natural, 3-day prefermentative maceration at 11ºC/52ºF in concrete tanks. Alcoholic fermentation was carried out with selected yeasts for 11 days at 26ºC/79ºF along with controlled pump-overs. The total maceration time took 3 weeks and the wine underwent malolactic fermentation during the 6 months that it spent in oak. After that, the final blend was defined. 

Its deep purple color make this 100% Malbec a true representative of wines from Vista Flores. This wine is distinguished by its aromatic complexity in which notes of red fruits like cherries, with ripe fruit, floral aromas of violets, vanilla and tobacco cigars stand out. The aromas extend to the palate, where black fruits such as blackberry with spicy notes are still present. Its medium structure gives a nice feeling of fullness in the mouth, while its silky tannins are in balance with an exquisite natural acidity that adds to a long finish."

At the winery, 25 percent of the harvest is fermented in open tanks and the remainder in stainless steel tanks. Ten percent of this blend is aged for six to nine months in French oak barrels.

The mild Mediterranean climate of this valley features warm and dry summers with rainfall occurring mostly during winter. These conditions are most favorable for the production of healthy grapes with excellent ripeness and concentration that result in flavorful and refined wines.

Grapes were handpicked and taken to the winery to be destemmed, crushed and transferred into stainless steel tanks where they underwent prefermentation cold maceration at 28º C approx.

The soils of this valley –mostly granite– and the influence of the refreshing breeze and morning fog contributed by the Pacific Ocean combine to allow grapes, mainly white varieties, to ripen at a leisurely pace, which ultimately results in expressive, balanced and mineral wines.

Once harvested, grapes were taken to the winery to be gently pressed. A portion of the wine was fermented with native yeasts in used barrels, and the remainder fermented in stainless steel tanks. Following fermentation, the wine was aged in contact with its lees in French oak barrels for six months. No malolactic fermentation was carried out to preserve the wine's natural acidity. 

Featuring a pale-yellow color, this Chardonnay delivers a delicate nose of toasted almonds, juicy citrus fruit and an appealing mineral profile. The palate exhibits a slightly creamy texture and its citrusy flavors are emboldened by notes of pear and mango. Hints of tropical fruit and roasted hazelnut linger on its finish."

Vintage Information- Napa Valley received a steady amount of rain during the winter months, saturating the ground and paving the way for the vintage to come. The early and mild spring saw a good berry set, while the rest of the season was marked by some significant heat spikes in June and August with one final spike over Labor Day Weekend, which all combined to make it one of the hotter years on record. While the harvest was slightly smaller than normal—with moderate berry and cluster size—the quality was exceptional.

Aging: 18 Months in French Oak Barrels

Vintage Information: The 2016 vintage was what some might call a “typical” Napa Valley vintage, with adequate and well-timed rain prior to and during the early growing season. The January rains left good moisture in the soil for the vines to begin the growing season with early bud-break; canopy growth was rapid and even. Additional rainfall in March and April supported the later vine growth as well. It was a warm but moderate summer and fog mitigated the heat extremes, causing fewer heat spikes, less dehydration and overall good uniform growth.

Fruit for our Sauvignon Blanc, principally sourced from our historic St. Helena estate, was hand-picked in the cool of night to ensure it reached the winery in pristine condition. The freshly picked grapes were cold-soaked on the skins for 6-8 hours, before going to press, a process that enhances the fruit’s natural aromatics. The wine was cold fermented slowly in stainless steel tanks to further its wonderfully aromatic bouquet and delicate flavor profile. 

Varietal: 100% Sauvignon Blanc

Aging: Stainless Steel tanks

Vintage Information: The 2019 vintage was best characterized as a steady, even growing season, where our vineyard managers had the luxury of letting each estate’s crop leisurely mature to perfection. Preceded by a cool, wet spring, the season got off to a late start, running about 10 days behind a typical cycle. Accordingly, verasion started a bit late, followed by pretty even heat and ripening thereafter. For the second year in a row, the harvest began in August but extended well into November. Like 2018, it remained relatively warm and dry until we took in the last of our fruit on November 8th. Winemaker Stacy Clark noted that the average sized harvest yielded grapes with smaller berries and loose clusters which lends good color and concentration.

Vintage information: The 2018 vintage featured near perfect growing conditions from start to finish. Abundant February rain gave way to a slightly late bud break, but from there on the vines and grape clusters enjoyed copious amounts of ripening sunshine tempered by cool maritime influences at night. Temperatures remained even and steady throughout the Summer and well into Fall, devoid of any major heat spikes. This all made for a leisurely unhurried harvest that extended well into November for the
reds. This extended hang-time on the vine led to fruit with great concentration of flavor and natural acidity.

Vintage Information:  Napa Valley’s 2016 Vintage was what some might call “typical”, with well-timed rain prior to and during the early growing season. The January rains left good moisture in the soil, bud-break came early and canopy growth was rapid and even. A warm but moderate summer followed, with fog mitigating the heat extremes and minimizing dehydration, leading to uniform growth overall.

Aging: 20 Months in new French Oak Barrels

Vintage Information: We proudly celebrated the harvest of 2011 and the 150th Anniversary of our founding year although a late harvest was due to below average temperatures, late spring rains, a cool growing season and rain during the summer. The winter rainfall was a full 30% above normal, much of it late. A few brief heat spikes did little to make up for the late start. We began harvest in early September when we characteristically begin in mid-August. Early rains followed while red fruit still hung on the vines. Hand thinning of the leaves and shoot positioning provided better sun exposure and maximum air flow that deterred the development of mold on these inherently resilient varieties with thicker skins. Our yield was 30% lower than a normal crop but essentially identical to last years. Brix was down over 6% from last year which could yield a drop in the final alcohol levels of almost 1%. It is exciting to achieve the flavors that we did this year with these lower sugars.

Vintage Information: The 2012 harvest was the largest on record for the Charles Krug Winery and, fortunately, it also possessed high overall quality, balance and color in part due to the fairly long, mild, growing season.  Due to the long season we found ourselves waiting for maturity in all varieties, and then faced some cooler temperatures and threat of rain as the season drew to a close. Fortunately, Mother Nature cooperated gracefully with us for this stellar vintage.  The grapes were very clean, the lots were very expressive aromatically, and in the case of the reds, very deeply colored.

Vinified, matured and estate botttled, San Giuseppe is in the top class. At only a few dollars more than lower class brands, San Giuseppe is a world apart in taste. Because San Giuseppe is a few dollars less than other DOC Pinot Grigio, San Giuseppe is a great value.    The Grape:  Pinot Grigio Venezia is created from 100% Pinot Grigio grapes grown on San Giuseppe’s own estates. As Pinot Grigio is a mutation of Pinot Noir, the fruit ranges in color from golden yellow to a dark pinkish hue, some showing an entire rainbow of colors on their skins. The grapes impart plenty of crisp, delicious flavor into the finished wine.    Winemaker Notes:  Italian Pinot Grigio wines are government classified. The highest class is Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC). DOC wines are from grapes grown in delimited areas known for having the best vineyards. Also, yields are government restricted that make richer more concentrated wines. Starting with the 2010 vintage, San Giuseppe Pinot Grigio is Denominazione di Origine Controllata, Venezia (Venice). Venezia is South of the other DOC Pinot Grigio regions. Hence, the wines are richer with more pronounced taste and bouquet. The Northern areas of Alto Adige, Trentino and Valdadige, generally produces wines that are lighter with a more acidic personality and less pronounced bouquet. The Eastern areas of Friuli and Collio, produces full bodied wines with a pronounced mineral flavor.   Since the first vintage of Pinot Grigio twenty years ago, consumers have appreciated San Giuseppe’s superior taste. Starting with the 2010 vintage, San Giuseppe superior taste is official.    Tasting Notes:  Now San Giuseppe is Denominazione di Origine Controllata, the officially the highest class for Pinot Grigio.   The result is a richer wine with a more pronounced bouquet.    By adjusting the temperature of wines, one can tune the flavors up or down to better pair with the accompanying food or individual preference. Warmer equals more, cooler equals less, ability possible only with top quality wines. Because cold conceals flaws lower quality wines most be served cooler and cannot deliver flavor.

As you probably know, the Finger Lakes region is best suited - and best known — for its aromatic white wines, particularly Riesling. Much of the time, the classic red varieties of Bordeaux struggle to ripen in central New York. Some wineries make wines like Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon anyway, but many of the better ones are made using fruit (or bulk wine) grown here on Long Island.     Anyway, Olsen-Harbich may have started his career dealing mostly with racy, minerally whites, but in his 27 years making wine on Long Island, he's more than adjusted to the climate and grapes here.

On the second day, the juice is racked to a clean tank, to include some fluffy lees, and inoculated with yeast. From there, the 4 different lots were separated into either concrete egg, puncheon, or barrels, or all three! After fermentation, usually lasting around 2 weeks, the barrels and puncheons were stirred during aging on the lees until blending 7 months later. The wine in the concrete egg was also stirred to kick up any lees, building a richer mouthfeel. At blending, barrels were selected to capture the essence of the Helena Bench site. ¬e resulting wine has a crisp acidity, savory minerality, and lots of fruity aromas like white nectarine and honeydew melon.

Bertani produces a full spectrum of the classic wines of the Veneto and has enjoyed a reputation for quality from the start.    Bertani was founded in 1857 by brothers Gaetano and Giovan Battista Bertani, prosperous wine merchants who believed that quality winemaking held the key to the future. The Bertanis invested their funds in buying some of the finest vineyards in the province and making their own wines. As a result, unlike most other local producers, Vinicola Bertani owns its own vineyards and so is able to oversee the entire winemaking cycle from start to finish.    Bertani owns vineyards and cellars in the Valpantena as well as land in the Soave area and in the areas around Lake Garda. The company headquarters are in the original cellars in Grezzana, north-east of Verona, where the historic vineyards are still to be found and where the work of vinification, aging and bottling take place today.    Production Area  Veneto, Italy Grapes are sourced from Bertani’s estate vineyards in the Soave district. The soil is basaltic with volcanic origin.    Grape Varieties  100% Pinot Grigio    Vinification  Grapes are harvested at the beginning of September and traditional white wine fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks at temperatures of 57-60ºF, with 50% of the juice undergoing malolactic fermentation. The wine then remains in tank on the lees for approximately five months. Following bottling, the wine rests three months before release.    Color  Pale gold    Bouquet  Complex bouquet with scents of golden apple and stone fruits    Taste  Crisp, dry and medium-bodied with flavors of apple, ripe peach and pear.

The soils in Cortona are well-drained lime-clay mixtures which— along with the great diurnal temperature shifts during growing season—allow Sangiovese to ripen to an optimal level while maintaining great acidity and balance. Maceration and alcoholic fermentation were completed in stainless steel tanks during a 22-day period, after which malolactic fermentation took place in French oak. Aging was split between a year in barrels and six months in bottles prior to release, and the process resulted in a color and acidity typical for this varietal, but a very soft experience for the palate. Once decanted, the wine is drinkable immediately, and buyers will see why the Smeriglio Sangiovese 2010 scored a 90 rating from Wine Spectator.    TASTE:  Bright ruby red shade.

But to be a complete Friuliophile?  Yet that is a title they both wear proudly. After working together at The French Laundry, Bobby as a Master Sommelier and Lachlan as a chef de partie, they moved to Boulder Colorado with the dream of opening a neighborhood restaurant. One fateful trip to Friuli, complete with carsickness from the winding roads of the Alps, traditional Friulian fare, and lots and lots of amazing local wine was enough to seal their fate. They came back to Boulder and opened Frasca Food and Wine, a restaurant dedicated to the cuisine and culture of Friuli. Always digging deeper for Friulian inspiration, Bobby and Lachlan travel to the region several times a year, even taking their entire staff along for a week of eating, wine tasting and general Friuli-worship every summer.  It was only natural that when Bobby and Lachlan dreamt about starting their own wine label they looked first to the beautiful whites of Friuli, and Scarpetta was born."

Bartholomew, former President of United Press International and occupied the land where European grape varieties were first commercially planted in America. Count Agoston Haraszthy, a Hungarian nobleman, acknowledged as the “Father of Modern California Viticulture,” collected 100,000 grape cuttings from France, Italy, Germany, and Spain, starting in 1857 the vineyards which surrounded Hacienda and made it a historic landmark. Steven MacRostie joined Hacienda as winemaker in 1974. His first wine, a 1974 Chardonnay, took a gold medal at the Sonoma County Harvest Fair. Fine Sonoma wines and the Hacienda label have been synonymous ever since. In 1992, The Franzia family purchased the rights to the Hacienda label and cased goods inventory. The family markets and distributes the brand on a national basis through Bronco Wine Company. The term, “Clair de Lune,” or moonlight, was first used with Hacienda's Chardonnay by Frank Bartholomew. His love of classical music, especially Claude Debussy's “Clair de Lune,” and the area in Sonoma where Hacienda was located, Valley of the Moon, prompted its use as a proprietary name.

About the Winery:
Olivier Leflaive was born into one of the most legendary Burgundian estates which he co-managed before starting his own venture, which is now legendary itself, Olivier Leflaive in 1985. This project allowed him to play with more wines outside of what his family owned in Puligny-Montrachet. Working with his winemaker, Franck Grux, they always focused on quality and transparency.

On the heels of a picture-perfect 2012 growing season, the 2013 vintage was another beaut. Spring came early and lasted long, with temperate conditions and ideal temperatures. Cool nights and overcast mornings followed by breezy warm afternoons made the summer months ideal for even ripening and good flavor development. At the winery, the fruit was gently whole-cluster pressed, then chilled and lightly settled before being transferred to stainless steel tanks and slowly fermented at cool temperatures to enhance the varietal aromatics. After fermentation, a portion of the wine was aged for 8 months on French oak. We prefer a Chardonnay that blends both stainless steel and oak-aged wine, allowing an elegant balance of the beautiful cool-climate fruit flavors of Monterey and lush notes of vanilla and toast.

The vines were replanted in the 70's and now show a high level of maturity and consistency. These qualities are further enhanced by the western facing location. We use the most modern fermentation concept of horizontal rotary fermenters to extract all the positive components and manage tannin extraction. Winemaker's comments: This vintage was close to our normal harvest dates. Our mountain-side vineyards are always 2  3 weeks ahead of the Valley floor because of their excellent drainage which moves the entire growing season ahead. The wine shows the complexity of the five-varietal blend. The vintage of 2004 was marked by nearly ideal conditions throughout. This means the fruit from our vineyard, which normally has a spicy personality, is more towards the bright fruit character. The flavors are concentrated and the finish has a lingering effect. All the aromas are in balance with the wine's 100% French oak barrel aging influence."

In an effort to keep the wine showing the exotic freshness that it showed in tank and then in barrel, we stopped malolactic fermentation about 15% of the way through, thus retaining higher acidity, freshness and vitality.

The wine shows a beautiful light straw color with seductive aromas of Meyer lemon, wet stone, lemon thyme, melon and ginger.

The Kamptal features gneiss and conglomerate soils at higher elevations, and cold air from the nearby Waldviertal forest provides optimal growing conditions for Riesling. Vinification is by spontaneous fermentation in stainless-steel tanks. 

Austrian Riesling is always made in a dry style and shows aromas and flavors of ripe citrus, stone fruit, and flowers, with a persistent underpinning of minerality. 

Riesling’s high acidity makes it one of the most versatile wines at the table. Riesling can be used to cut the fattiness of foods such as pork or sausages and can tame saltiness. Conversely, it can highlight foods such as fish or vegetables in the same way a squeeze of lemon or a vinaigrette enhances a dish."

Working this for three days the wine gained more flesh and mid palate breadth without losing any vibrancy and freshness. This is impressive and represents excellent value."

The vast variety of soils gives the final wine an interesting complexity. As the vines are over 25+ years old, lower yields of 6-8 tonnes/ha help to deliver flavoursome, concentrated fruit and the berries are picked when fully phenologically ripe. The grapes are destemmend and crushed, with a slow start to fermentation at a low temperature 17C then gradually increasing after three days to 22 - 24C for full fermentation. Pump-over takes place twice daily to wet the cap and aerate the fermenting wine. Wine is fermented down to 5 g/litre residual sugar and pressed before being pumped back into stainless steel tanks. This ensures soft tannins and no-over extraction of any harsh tannins. Malo-lactic fermentation follows and the wine is kept on the lees until bottling.

The grape when grown in Alsace creates a wine that is quite different, with more richness and complexity than Pinot Grigio, even though they are the same grape. The resulting wine is dry as well as aromatic, with rich apricot and peach notes on the nose.

From a drastic selection of the best grapes purchased from winegrowers under long-term contract in a dozen of the most favored localities in and around the village of Riquewihr and includes a sizable amount of grapes declassified from some Grand Cru vineyards of the Hugel estate. The hand-picked grapes were taken intact to the presses, filled by gravity, the must decanted for a few hours, then fermented in temperature-controlled vats with natural yeasts.

From the winemaker: Rich and full but still dry. Pinot Gris can be discreet, but also has the longest aging potential. The bouquet is soft and supple, intense, characteristically open and expressive, with fully ripe fruit notes, apricot, wild plum, licorice, a touch of buttery brioche, sesame seed, pistachio and fresh hazelnut. The wine fills the mouth and is well constructed, suave, velvety, soft and almost juicy, with a nice long aromatic finish.

“JJ” Bourgogne Blanc is a tribute to Jean Jacques Vincent who has managed the family domaine of Château Fuissé for 40 years. It is a distinctive wine exclusively from the southern part of Burgundy near Mâcon and Pouilly-Fuissé. Naturally rich soils with a high proportion of clay in the region give the wines a rich, mineral character. Because the summer temperatures are generally higher in the Macon than in northern Burgundy, the wines are rich and ripe fruit character and soft acidity. 

About the Winery:
J.J. Vincent produces a range of wines made with the same care and expertise as those made at the Vincent’s historic domaine, Château Fuissé. Made primarily from grapes sourced from Mâconnais vineyards in the South of Burgundy that are owned by members of Jean-Jacques Vincent’s family, these wines are of extremely high quality and represent remarkable value.

Vineyard - Our 2017 Baby Blue boasts over 55% Blue Rock Estate fruit plus a whopping 47% Cabernet Sauvignon. The medium body and gentle tannins of the vintage easily invited both the additional structure and impressive depth contributed by this noble grape. As always, the remainder of our assemblage celebrates the five primary varietals of Bordeaux plus a bit of Syrah, all from prime neighboring sites to complete this gorgeous cépage.

Winemaker's Tasting Notes - 2017 was cooperative for much of the growing season, but required patience and bravery as we approached harvest, with uncertain weather right up until it was finally the perfect time to pick each block. No rookies here, we relied on our many years of experience and are once again delighted with the results. Baby Blue is always built for pleasure right out of the gate and this beautifully aromatic rendition is no exception. Loads of rich red and black fruits, plus a delightful hint of blueberry, all get the party started. This is followed up by a nice compliment of baking spices, vanilla, a kiss of gentle herbs, and just the right amount of beautiful French oak and earthy goodness to round things out on the finish. Wonderful length and supple tannins make for easy enjoyment of this joyous red."

Winemaker's Tasting Notes - The 2017 vintage showcases our team’s years of experience and talent: Two early heat waves challenged the faint of heart as harvest approached, but through meticulous farming and steel-nerved patience, we saw our vineyards through to a glorious finish. The resulting wine tells a beautiful tale of the vintage, our team and our stunning and unique property. A pristine, deep ruby hue is followed by a spicy and absolutely captivating nose. Powerful, young and still primary aromas of black currant, peppercorn and damp earth with just hint of bay leaf and vanilla confirm you have a noble Cabernet in the glass. The palate is both mouthcoating and lithe, with ripe tannins that offer balanced structure and support to the loads of black cherry, blueberry and baking spices.

On the palate, this wine is a juicy attack of Bing cherries, integrated oak and raspberries with a long smooth finish.

Combining three counties, each in its own distinct AVA, Cherry Pie Pinot Noir showcases the best of each counties unique flavor profile. The Sonoma County grapes are primarily sourced from the Russian River Valley which is a warmer growing climate for Pinot Noir that results in lush juicy fruit flavors with an undertone of minerality from the soil. The grapes from Monterey County are sourced from the Alta Loma Vineyard and Arroyo Loma Vineyard which overlook the Salinas River Valley and are planted on gravelly loam soil which creates rich, concentrated earthly flavors in the fruit. The Santa Barbara County grapes are from the Los Alamos Vineyard which lies tucked into a canyon that leads directly to the Pacific Ocean. The sandy soils, bright sunshine and cool ocean breezes combine to lengthen fruit ripening and extend hang time, resulting in intense aromatics and great acidity.

The pinot grapes that go into the Cherry Pie Tri-County Pinot Noir are harvest at night to keep them cool which creates stable sugar levels and better levels of acidity, as well as ensuring the fruit is less bruised in transport to the winery. The grapes are then fermented in individual county lots and brought together in the blending process. Cherry picking the best lots from the various counties , the wines selected are those that best exemplify the characteristics of each county’s terroir.

-Vineyard:
Carneros, home of some of the best Pinot Noir in the world. Our vineyard is located in the north end of Carneros, on the Napa Valley side, right on the foothills of Mount Veeder and Mayacamas mountains. The soil is volcanic and its farming is organic (Napa Green Certified Land).
3 distinctive parcels within the same 400 acres property.

-2019 Vintage:
We still brag about how excellent 2018 vintage was in Carneros, but 2019 may just steal the show as the vintage of the decade for Pinot Noir in Napa. Time will tell, but as I’m writing these tasting notes (July 2020), I am astonished with the early development and elegance of this vintage every time I uncork a bottle. Although 2019 vintage has the structure to last years in the cellar, its freshness makes it “The House” wine for today’s occasion.

-Tasting Notes:
Wild strawberries, rhubarb, pomegranate and black cherries aromas are all found on the nose. The palate is so silky and smooth with lingering flavors of cranberry, ripe plum and spice. Expect flavors of earth, black tea and dried cherries to show up with age.

Rixford planted his famous La Questa Vineyard with these selections, in the same proportions as found at Margaux.  In the late 1940s Martin Ray planted his first Cabernet vineyard with cuttings from the La Questa Vineyard. The present-day Estate Cabernet Sauvignon vines were planted in the early 1980s using cuttings taken from these vines. Yields are low, typically one to two tons per acre. Soils are very thin (1-12 inches), with a dominant base of Franciscan shale. The climate is cool, especially for Cabernet, and influenced by the vineyard’s altitude and its proximity to San Francisco bay and the Pacific Ocean. The vines are trellised in a modern fashion, which allows for a more uniform ripening. The vineyard also contains small blocks of Merlot and Cabernet Franc."

The huge  diurnal temperature variation, adds to the  structure and concentration of the wine.  VINTAGE  CONDITIONS    2014 was an outstanding vintage. Comprised of 10 Pinot Noir clones, spread across three different terraces, the vineyard’s challenge was to enhance individual expression of the fruit whilst ensuring even ripening. In 2014 picking was slightly early; the call was based on the tannin and flavour profile, where floral notes and vibrancy of flavour took preference. There was a swing towards whole bunch fruit which delivers texture, layered tannins and juicy acid profile.  GRAPE  VARIETY    Pinot Noir  MATURATION    The grapes were gently de-stemmed, allowing whole berries to remain intact. After a week long cold soak, each parcel was fermented separately, with a combination of wild and cultured yeast. The batches were hand plunged to extract the vibrant colour, flavour and delicate tannin structure. Parcel’s were pressed separately to a mix of new and used French oak barrels or remained in tank. In the spring after completing malolactic fermentation, each parcel and tank was tasted and blended."

Yountville’s unique position between the warmer upper reaches of the valley and the much cooler regions in the south, allow it to produce red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon that come closest in quality and style to the great wines of Bordeaux. One reason this is so can be explained by what is known as the Yountville Mounts. The Mounts is a small, forested hill that sits in the middle of the northern part of the region. It serves as a backstop for the fog rolling in from the San Pablo bay further south. Once trapped, the fog gently falls as a cooling mist on the vines below, and mixes with the warmer air of the valley. This climate translates into some of the best “old world” style of Cabernet that you will find in California."

At Bravante Vineyards, we have 2 blocks of merlot, one at each end of our Stoneridge Vineyard.  They both add distinctive facets to our estate grown merlot. At the northern end of the property is Block 1, which is classic merlot- rich, fruity and complex.  At the southern end is Block 5, which is all ‘Howell Mountain’- intense, minerally and structured. Blended together they produce layers of varietal Merlot flavors, dark and concentrated with a firm, structured backbone.

Winemaker notes: Our 2013 merlot has intense aromas of cherry and cassis, blended with sage and hints of cedar and pepper. The luscious body has nice firm tannins and flavors of ripe strawberry, raspberry with hints of mineral and oak, and a long supple berry finish.

Vibrant plums and berries with a succulent core of fleshy, powerful merlot fruit. There’s a serious edge to the finish. A blend of 90 per cent merlot and 10 per cent cabernet sauvignon. Drink or hold.

The Red of Valtellina DOC of ARPEPE was born in 2003 in a torrid summer, hard for our vineyards and our vineyards. It was not right to develop such fatigue by selling the grapes, which were unsuitable for long-aging vinification.

We harvested our Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards throughout the month of October and into early November, a testament to gradual, even ripening. This year 86% of the grapes come from Howell Mountain, Atlas Peak and Mt. Veeder AVA vineyards: the balance coming from the valley floor in Rutherford. This is the highest percentage of mountain fruit in our Napa Cabernet that we have bottled to date, slightly more than the 2008 vintage. The result is a very dark, densely colored wine, rich in aromatics and intensely flavored. This is a Napa Cabernet Sauvignon showing great varietal character as well as its complex mountain terroir.

After some extended bottle aging, we still find the same aromatic and flavor characters that we had used as descriptors early in the life of this wine. There is wonderful intensity but now a much richer mouth-feel thanks to a softening of tannins. Aromas of spice, dark fruit, mocha and tobacco accompanying the classic Cabernet cassis character. Flavors of blackberry, cherry, plum, cocoa, espresso and allspice are framed by earthy, lingering, dusty (Rutherford Dust) tannins plus tobacco and cedar notes. All the virtues of this vintage show well as a young wine and should continue to cellar well for many years."

(Its 8% Syrah component is not novel, though not all growers of Sangiovese would own up to that.) I don't think there is much mystery about what makes this wine so expressive and successful. Gentle fermentative extraction in open-top wooden uprights is followed by maturation in large ovals and demi-muids rather than barriques...and not too many of them new, either. This cepage had been in the Leonetti line-up since 1995, so when the decision was made to move into estate-bottling mode, a place was found for it both in the Seven Hills and Loess vineyards. Roasted chestnut, game, violet, and lightly-cooked cherry rise from the glass, then inform a palate whose sense of tannic grit is not at all coarse but sufficient to add invigoration and almost certainly enhance this wine's adaptability at table. While I strongly suspect that low-level brett is responsible for some of the personality on exhibit here - and in consequence I'd monitor stocks carefully if planning to cellar any - it, for now, in no way lacks for lip-smacking primary juiciness that extends all the way through a vibrant, saliva-liberating finish. And the liveliness here, incidentally, isn't on account of any acid adjustment (though Figgins did add tartaric to selected lots of Cabernet and Merlot in this vintage, as he says he typically will one year in three). ""We love what Sangiovese does,"" says Gary Figgins, ""but viticulturally it's a challenge. We found, for instance, that interior berries weren't getting good exposure, so now we go through right after bloom with a hair comb"" to remove one third or more of the embryonic fruit within each cluster.

As a producer all you can ask from Mother Nature is avoiding extremes and enough time to get everything accomplished how you want, but more importantly, when you want.  2013 was exactly that.  While a warm, dry Spring advanced the season placing the ripenening times in August and September instead of September and October, we avoided dramatic heat spells that often accompany such advanced timing.  This allowed all grapes to be harvested at a time that was correct for that variety, ranch and specific block.  The vintage is emerging as one with tremendous purity and freshness.         Winemaker Notes         2013 may have provided one of the best vintages to date for Star Lane Sauvignon Blanc.  With extremely well balanced yields the time to develop great depth of flavor at fresh, balanced textures was second to none.  Toward harvest we were blessed with wonderful weather allowing us to segment and optimize each section to the Sauvignon Blanc.  To preserve the freshness of the vintage we utilized a champagne style press cycle ensuring purity of the juice, even at the expense of yields.

2016 was another warm year with full ripeness in the fruit which allowed for the fruit notes in the wine to be a blend of black fruit (boysenberry, black cherry, blueberry and cassis) and red fruit (cherry, cranberry and raspberry). This brings more depth and concentration to the wine, along with a fine balance with all components getting along well with each other. This makes the wine a synergy and much more enjoyable. The wine is rich and deep with flavors of black cherry, boysenberry, cranberry, cassis and white pepper. The finish is the sweet flavor of toasted oak from French wine barrels.

Before you taste this wine, check out the incredible color. It's a beautiful dark ruby red with a slight hint of blue - It reminds me of the beautiful tail light lenses on 1940's vintage cars. The aromas swirl around in the glass and blend together. The fruit notes are candied cranberry and cassis, then rich vanilla from the toasted white oak, and a rich earth or mushroom aroma. The wine is definitely full flavored, but without imposing tannins. The predominant flavors are cranberry and fig fruit notes on a mocha framework. The rose petal notes, sweet rich earth and fresh cracked pepper flavors seem to get along beautifully. Not the flash of tangerine in the finish.

These conditions allowed the vines to establish a large, but balanced crop, which steadily ripened until our Cabernet harvest began in early October. Mother Nature held back on her fall rains, enabling us to bring in each block at optimal ripeness before the end of the month.    The 2012 Far Niente Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of mixed berry fruit, boysenberry, chocolate covered cherries, layered with hints of graphite and toasted oak.

For many, the claim above may seem at odds with the sea of chaptalized, low-quality wine exported from Germany in the late 20th Century. In truth, very little of that infamous wine was Riesling at all (Riesling became a scapegoat for higher-yielding grapes such as Muller-Thurgau and Silvaner), but the reputation has nonetheless stuck. No less unshakeable a stereotype is of Riesling as just a sweet grape, used only to make sticky wines."

Well into their seventies, Alfred and Rolf still tend the vines and make the wines with little help: heading into the steep Würzgarten and Treppchen to tie the posts, harvest, and then even racking off the large fuders they use for fermentation and blending. The vineyard holdings of this tiny, 1.9 hectare estate are divided between the Ürziger Würzgarten, Erdener Treppchen, and Kinheimer Rosengarten. Wine cultivation is ancient on these sites, lying just off the Mosel between Ürzig and Erden is the excavation of a Roman press house. When most of the Ürziger Würzgarten vineyards were replanted during the re-alignment of the vineyards (called “Flurbereinigung”), Merkelbach’s vines remained on original rootstock, with an average vine age of 45 years. The Merkelbachs are firm believers in tradition, and while changes in climate and style preferences have pushed up must weights and produced profoundly riper wines, the brothers craft wines of a style more typical to an era long forgotten. Kabinetten are still refreshing, Spätlesen taste like Spätlesen, and oechsle levels rarely exceed the Pradikät range"

The grapes are picked in bunches during the month of September, and placed on mats to dry until January, February. The wine is then placed in steel basins until July or August. It is then aged for 3 years, partly in oak barrels and partly in French barriques.

Capitel de Roari is a premium Amarone, coming from the best grape selection, and receiving delicate oak treatment. This is a well-balanced Amarone that still exhibits much of the dark fruit flavors, earth and meaty components expected of Valpolicella.

This wine complements steak or pork roasts, hearty pastas and seasonal cheeses.
Enjoy!"

This is the second most sought-after wine from the region (in terms of user searches). There has been a lowering of demand in the past year.  This is among the highest-priced Rosso di Montalcino wine. The price has been stable over the past year.    All Valdicava grapes are organically grown and no chemical pesticides or fertilizers are used in the vineyards     The Valdicava Rosso is made from the estate’s youngest vines, all of which are Brunello-designated. In 2010 Abbruzzese gave his Rosso an additional 4-5 months in cask above the usual 8-10 months. He describes the wine as “too important for a Rosso” and I tend to agree as this is by no means an approachable, easy going wine. Anticipated maturity: 2013-2025. Vincenzo Abbruzzese is one of the most outspoken, passionate growers in Montalcino. His beautifully tended vineyards yield some of the richest wines in the region; and that’s where most of the focus is – on the vineyards. The winery itself is unremarkable and is equipped with just the bare essentials. All of the wines are aged in large, neutral oak; what comes through is Abbruzzese’s commitment to low yields, sustainable farming and non-interventionalist winemaking consistently demonstrate richness and excellent structure."

Cooler regions and stainless steel fermentation tend to produce Tempranillos with fresh strawberry and cherry like fruit, similar in body to Pinot Noir. Examples from hotter, more arid regions that undergo extended oak aging often produce richer, plumper, jammier wines, typically exhibiting chocolate, tobacco, and leather notes. Tempranillo provides the backbone of the highly regarded wines of Rioja, Toro and Ribera del Duero. In Rioja particularly, it is typically blended with Garnacha (Grenache), Mazuelo (Carignan) and Graciano. In La Mancha and Navarra, it is commonly blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot to produce inexpensive, great-value wines. One of the few places Tempranillo has spread to is Spain’s neighbour, Portugal.

Nebbiolo wine goes back far into history, and has been described by Roman authors and in medieval writings. The etymological origins are uncertain: some believe the name comes from the fact that harvesting is very late in the season when the first mists mask the vines, others think it is for the fine grey-blue colour that coats the grapes- recalling the colour of mist. This is a grape that blooms early and ripens late, permitting the vine to accumulate large amounts of organic substances excellent for the fruit, thus providing a very complete composition which is expressed in the rich opulence and complexity of the wine. Nebbiolo is the maximum expression of local winegrowing excellence, and has always been destined for bottling. On the steep sunny slopes of the Roero hillsides, Nebbiolo grapes absorb those characteristics of refined elegance that make Nebbiolo inimitable and unique, placing it among the aristocracy of the great Italian wines."

The estate has been in the hands of the Mazzei family for 26 generations. This dynamic family has carefully safeguarded the inherent beauty and rich heritage of Fonterutoli, while simultaneously implementing measures to ensure cuttingedge quality in the vineyards and cellars. An exciting example of this dedication to quality is the construction of a stunning new cellar that operates via gravity and clean energy, and has already been defined as “the most impressive in the entire Chianti region” by Steven Spurrier of Decanter magazine.

The notable merchant, Ser Lapo Mazzei, is credited for authoring the first official document mentioning “Chianti wine” (December 16, 1398). Years later, Philip Mazzei, winemaker, political thinker and friend of Thomas Jefferson, is credited for influencing another historic document, whose philosophical writings on equality of man served as inspiration for the U.S. Declaration of Independence.

The best-crafted Argentine Malbecs enjoy similar flavor to those made in Europe, but with softer, lusher structure.     Successful Argentine Malbec growers know that, in order to develop full maturity and distinction, Malbec needs ""hang time"" even after sugar levels indicate ripeness. Hand harvesting also ensures that only the ripest and most pristine bunches are selected.     Argentine Malbecs tend to age well and offer durability and long term cellaring potential.     “By the year 2015, the greatness of Argentinean wines made from the Malbec grape will be understood as a given. This French varietal has reached startling heights of quality in Argentina. Both inexpensive, delicious Malbecs and majestic, profoundly complex ones from high-elevation vineyards are already being produced, and by 2015 this long-ignored grape's place in the pantheon of noble wines will be guaranteed.”    - Robert Parker, The Wine Advocate, December 2007"

Vineyard Notes  Yet another difficult growing season. Spring was erratic giving us plenty of rain after the fruit set and heat spikes followed soon after that. We were on our toes adjusting with each jab nature gave us. Yields were down 30% and the fruit that we deemed worthy enough to survive the cluster thinning and green drops were immensely round and intense. The Merlot yields were down to about 2 tons and acre and the Cabernet yields down to about 1.5 tons an acre. As a result there isn't much to go around this vintage so get them while you can."

If I have to describe the 2012 harvest with one word, intense is what it comes to mind! The last similar vintage was 1997 when everything ripened at the same time and there was a lot of it! Following the low yielding 2011, this harvest was expectedly larger and one of the largest in the history of Trentadue as far as total grapes made to wine. The quality of all varieties is outstanding!    We harvested the 2012 Merlot Block 500 grapes at the end of September. The average sugar at harvest was 25 Brix - ideal for making high quality, age worthy wines. The fermentation was completed in four separate tanks with three different yeast clones. Post fermentation, the wine was aged on the grape skins for a total of 21 days. Post pressing, the wine was racked twice and pumped into 38% new, mostly French and other European oak barrels.  The balance was placed into older mixed barrels.    Our 2012 La Storia Merlot is a fine example of the ability of this classic Bordeaux variety to make a solid, tasty and age worthy wine.  The main aromas and flavors are of dark cherry, plum, black licorice and herbs. The new oak contributes a touch of vanilla, brown sugar, cocoa dust and toast.

The grapes for our 2013 Sauvignon Blanc come from the Bellacana Vineyard, directly across the Russian River from our Estate. Approximately 25% of the grapes are from the Muskee clone, which brings a slight Muscat aroma to the wine. We purposely did not make a ""grassy"" style Sauvignon Blanc, our goal was a riper style with more tropical fruit with melon and apricot aromas. The body is viscous and full, finishing sweet on the mouth, although there is no residual sugar in it at all. The wine was slowly fermented at cold temperatures to preserve more of the aromatics and achieve a fuller and viscous body. No oak was used during aging.

Post harvest and sorting, the Chardonnay was whole cluster pressed, fermented and settled in tank, and racked to  a combination of stainless steel and neutral French oak. The long, cool fermentation was followed by elevage in entirely neutral vessels, and the wine was bottled in July of 2012. The wine did not undergo Malolactic fermentation.  Tasting Notes  Vibrant aromas of yellow apple, summer melon and jasmine are complimented by flavors of ginger blossom, confit  lemon and starfruit.

Tannins are well condensed with anthocyanins, adding red hues, and resulting in a roundness and softness in which the typical structure of Cabernet prevails. Valle de Uco produces this varietal with notable structure, which makes it suitable for long- term storage.

The steeply-terraced vineyard existed in Roman times. Austrian Riesling is often defined by elevated levels of dry extract thanks to a lengthy ripening period and freshness due to dramatic temperature swings between day and night. Wines from Achleiten’s highly complex soils are famously marked by a mineral note of flint or gun smoke, are intensely flavored, and reliably long-lived.

Riesling’s high acidity makes it one of the most versatile wines at the table. Riesling can be used to cut the fattiness of foods such as pork or sausages and can tame some saltiness. Conversely, it can highlight foods such as fish or vegetables in the same way a squeeze of lemon or a vinaigrette might."

Grapes are grown at various vineyards, strategically-planted locations that provide optimal conditions for each varietal. They produce a wide range of wines in dry white, red, rosé, sparkling and sweet styles    Several vintages have been winning prizes in competitions: the 2011 vintage was awarded Bronze from the Decanter World Wine Awards, and the 2008 vintage was awarded Bronze from the International Wine & Spirit Competition.  Only a couple of critics have rated this Lujan de Cuyo wine so far.  This is priced above average for red wine from Lujan de Cuyo. The price has been stable over the past year.    Malbec is a black-skinned grape variety native to south-western France (specifically the area around Cahors), but now better known as the iconic wine grape of Argentina. Through its success in the vineyards of Mendoza, in a few short decades Malbec has shot from relative obscurity to international fame, simultaneously bringing new-found attention and respect to Argentina as a wine-producing nation.    Malbec typically ripens midway through the growing season and produces small, intensely colored grapes. As it is so sensitive to its growing environment, the level of ripeness has a considerable effect on the structure of the eventual wine. Broadly speaking, French Malbec tends to be more meaty, rustic and tannic, while examples from Argentina seem to be uniformly rich, ripe, jammy and juicy. On both sides of the Atlantic, Malbec wines are generally aged in oak to enhance the wine’s structure and aging potential."

Less vine growth is easier to manage, so long as the crop load is appropriately balanced. The fruit clusters began the year with fewer than usual flowers, as a result of the cool spring of 2007 when these smaller clusters were laid down for our current year. A week of warm temperatures in March gave us early budbreak, rapid growth and flowering about ten days earlier than typical, but changable weather during flowering caused some shatter (when flowers do not set fruit), an event rare in Cabernet but common in Malbec and Merlot. The slight shatter made the already small open clusters even lighter. Given the smaller vines, this lighter crop load was naturally closer to balance and required less vineyard work to balance the vines. We still came through and performed a post-veraison green drop, where the last ripe fruit is removed, as this is an essential step to control fruit quality. Overall, the growing season was mild and fairly cool which promoted even and gradual development with the exception of a late August heat spike that quickened sugar accumulation, and early cold snaps in late September sent the vines into fall senescence in October."

Today it is the most planted red varietal in the world. Identified as a descendent of Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, the late-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon needs to be planted in warmer climates to fully ripen. Its small berries can easily be identified for their distinctive blue color, thick skins and high tannins. And while the varietal has its own definitive characteristics: green pepper-like aromas and black currant flavors among them, it is perhaps most prized for its ability to convey terroir, vintage and winemaking. A relatively new varietal, Cabernet Sauvignon started making inroads into the wines of the Médoc and Graves in the late-18th century. Today it is also dominant in the up-and-coming Entre-Deux-Mers region of Bordeaux and can also be found in Southwest France. It is the companion varietal to Sangiovese in Italy's Super Tuscans and is planted all over Europe, stretching to lesser-known winegrowing regions like Russia and Lebanon. In the Americas Cabernet Sauvignon has found champions in every nook and cranny of California and among winemakers in Washington, where it complements plantings of Merlot. In South America, Cab thrives in Chile, but can also be found in smaller amounts in Argentina and even in Mexico."

Morat selects 100% Chardonnay grapes from several of his hillside Vergisson sites at 300-350 meters of altitude, each with different soils, for his first-level Pouilly Fuissé. For this cuvee, Morat ferments and ages the wine in 60% stainless steel tanks and 40% barrels, which are between 4 and 8 years old and hence, do not impart oaky flavors. Morat’s goal is to produce a wine that shows the intensity and purity characteristic of outstanding vineyards and winemaking, but which is also very accessible upon release for its expressive and vivid fruit. The wine captures the unique character of its Vergisson terroir: pure and fresh, green apple, citrus and peach flavors with a soft minerality, imparting finesse and length."

It produces light, dry white wines famed for their minerality and crisp acidity. AOC Chablis wines are produced exclusively from Chardonnay.    Chablis is located in northern Burgundy (Bourgogne), although the town and its vineyards are located a considerable distance (more than 60 miles/100 km) north-west of Burgundy's main wine-producing areas around Nuits-Saint-Georges, Beaune, Chalon-sur-Saone and Macon. They are in fact closer to Sancerre (Loire) and Les Riceys (southern Champagne). Consequently, Chablis has a cooler climate than the rest of Burgundy, which contributes significantly to the style of wine its vineyards produce. The effects of terroir on wine can be seen more clearly in Chablis than almost anywhere else.    Chablis  Vineyards in Chablis  A key division within Chablis lies between terroirs with Kimmeridgian soils and those with Portlandian soils. Kimmeridgian soil is more highly regarded; it contains greater levels of mineral-rich clay, as well as the essential marine fossils which are responsible for its significant lime content. Kimmeridgian soils are the source of the trademark minerality in Premier Cru and Grand Cru wines from Chablis. By contrast, Portlandian soils are not so rich in clay and fossils, which results in slightly fruitier wines with a less mineral profile. Petit Chablis wines are most often grown in Portlandian soils.    Chablis wines are made in a style rather different from those produced elsewhere in Burgundy. They are drier and fresher, rather than more weighty and richly flavored. Unlike typical Burgundian white wines, which are barrel fermented, Chablis is usually entirely free of any oak influence. Very few Chablis producers use oak barrels in their winemaking and the exceptions are restricted to the higher-quality wines, whose extra complexity and depth mean that the wines are not overpowered by oak flavors.    The vineyards of Chablis are classified into four tiers of quality. Starting from the top, they are: Chablis Grand Cru, Chablis Premier Cru, Chablis and Petit Chablis. Wines which conform to the general Chablis appellation laws may claim the classification held by the vineyard where they were grown.    The appellation AOC Chablis is the most prolific and geographically widespread of the four classifications. It was created in 1938 – at the same time as the Chablis Grand Cru appellation – to protect the Chablis name, which was being used around the world to describe wines bearing little resemblance to the real Chablis. Today, all wines carrying the Chablis title are dry whites made exclusively from Chardonnay. They must be produced from vineyards in a specifically designated area surrounding Chablis town and its nearby villages.    Chablis Premier Cru is not a distinct appellation like the other three classifications, but rather a quality sub-division of the standard AOC Chablis title. Its geographical coverage is significantly larger than that of Chablis Grand Cru. There are 40 climats (vineyard sites) around Chablis which are deemed worthy of the Premier Cru title, and these are further subdivided into roughly 80 specific vineyards. The wines produced under this title are made according to quality controls that are halfway between those of the Chablis and Grand Cru Chablis appellations.    Chablis Grand Cru wines are produced from just 250 acres (100ha) of vineyards planted on gentle south-west-facing slopes at the eastern edge of the town. There are seven named Grand Cru climats. Running from north to south along the Serein river they are: Preuses, Bougros, Vaudesir, Grenouilles, Valmur, Les Clos and Blanchot. Wines claiming the Grand Cru title are made under stringent regulations; the maximum permitted yield is lower than for standard Chablis, and the minimum potential alcohol one degree higher. Chablis Grand Cru wines respond well to bottle ageing for between 10 and 15 years.    Petit Chablis is the least prestigious of the Chablis appellations. It was created in 1944 to cover the less highly rated vineyard sites in the area, generally located on plateaux above the Premier Cru or Grand Cru sites. Because they are more exposed to wind, and are not angled towards the afternoon sun, these sites do not benefit from the same climatic and geological advantages as the better vineyards, and produce less complex, less refined wines.    Just 8 miles (13km) south-west of Chablis lie two villages with their own wine styles and appellations. These are Irancy (Pinot Noir) and Saint-Bris (Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris)."

About the producer: In her travels to find a California wine that would over-deliver for its price, Lia Tolaini-Banville met with countless winemakers and tasted through a lot of uninspiring wine so that you wouldn't have to. Eventually she met with a winemaker who had deep ties to the Napa, Sonoma and Lodi growers he works with every day, and who allow him to hand select fruit in their vineyards every vintage. His understanding of those terroirs and the results that can be produced in blending them resulted in a fragrant wine with depth, balance and complexity. For the label, Lia chose to use the whimsical piece ""The Golden Bridge"" by artist Francis Kirk."

About the Brand:
Domaine Billaud-Simon was founded in 1815 after Charles Louis Noël Billaud planted vines on his family’s holdings upon returning home from the Napeolonic Wars. Over time the estate has expanded and is now composed of 42 acres, encompassing some of the most prized Grand Cru and Premier Cru vineyards in Chablis. Through changes at the estate and technical improvements they are continually striving to improve their quality and uphold the Domaine Billaud-Simon’s style of elegance, balance, and pure Chardonnay. The wines are delicious when young and can also evolve beautifully with age

Critical Acclaim:
2018: 93 points Wine Enthusiast
“Aromatic notes of Conference pear are vivid on the nose of this wine. The palate adds zestiness, suggesting white citrus pith on the midpalate that channels the fruity abundance and gives tension and texture, scented with lemon freshness. The finish is dry, bright and refreshing, with a lovely smidgeon of that Chablis chalkiness.” Anne Krebiehl, Wine Enthusiast

All of our lieux-dits, each vinified separately, are the basis of this wine and represent the DNA of Classique. In the words of Louis Barruol, “This wine is like you and me—we are individually unique, but we represent all of our ancestors at the same time. We carry their traits.”

The 2018 vintage marks the 6th consecutive score of 91+ points (Wine Spectator) for this wine.

At Forge Cellars, we systematically adhere to the less than 4 g/L threshold because this is how we want to express our idea of what we call “Bone Dry” Riesling.  We have experienced perfect balance, precision, style, finesse, and terroir expression between 1.5 g/L and 4 g/L. This low level of residual sugar creates stable wines that allow us to work at very low total sulfur levels, and can firmly be considered “dry.”

Forge Cellars has quickly become known as a benchmark producer for Dry Riesling in the Finger Lakes (Upstate New York) and in the United States. In 2017, their Dry Riesling Classique appeared on Wine Spectator’s Top 100 Wines of the Year in position number 31.

Partners, Louis Barruol (Château de Saint Cosme in Gigondas, France), and Richard Rainey have been working together since their first vintage in 2011 to produce hand-crafted, terroir-driven, bone dry Riesling and cool-climate Pinot Noir. Focusing on the east side of Seneca Lake—the deepest of the Finger Lakes at 620ft—the duo works with several premier sites with considerable slope and an abundance of different clones and soils. They have long-term relationships with growers throughout the region, and work closely with them to cultivate healthy grapes and develop viticultural programs that work well for each individual site. Bellows is the estate vineyard at Forge Cellars, which is farmed biointesively and densely-planted to Riesling and Pinot Noir."

In truth, very little of that infamous wine was Riesling at all (Riesling became a scapegoat for higher-yielding grapes such as Muller-Thurgau and Silvaner), but the reputation has nonetheless stuck.

The best vineyards are situated along rivers such as the Rhine and the Mosel, which temper the extremes of weather and help the grapes ripen. German wines are named after the places they come from, usually a combination of a village name, a vineyard name, and a grape name. German law makes no distinctions of quality between vineyards. As a result, many wines are mass-produced. Look for the classification QbA or QmP to assure that the grower is reputable. The finest wines are given a Prädikat, which is an indication of the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. There are six levels of Prädikat; in order from the least ripe to the ripest they are Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese (BA) Eiswein, and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA). At the three highest levels, the amount of sugar in the grapes is so high that the wines are inevitably sweet, but since Prädikat is an indication of the amount of sugar in the grape at harvest (and not in the wine) the lower levels of Prädikat offer no direct hint about the wine’s sweetness."

The vines are spurred-cordon or Cappuccina trained on marl and sandstone soils. The average vine density is 1800 vines per acre and the average yield is production is 3.25 tons per acre.     Vinification: The grapes are harvested in early September, when they are perfectly ripe. The grapes are crushed and stalks removed. The free-run juice is transferred to tank where it begins fermentation at low temperatures. The remaining must stays in contact with the skin for about 12 hours at 50°F (crio-maceration process). The skins are then removed and the must undergoes fermentation at 55.5°F, followed by malolactic fermentation.

It's the ""chameleon"" of white wines because the same grape variety, grown in different parts of the world, has a totally different taste.    It is also sometimes labelled Fumé Blanc (see our video) and, in France, is known by the wine regions where it is produced—Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)—especially Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé in the Loire Valley. Bordeaux Blanc or White Bordeaux is composed mostly of Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon grapes.

The vines are planted at an altitude that varies between 330 and 660 feets above sea level, in 2005. Soils have thin layer of loamy soil, placed on a stratum of clay and metamorphic rock (slate/schist), providing the minerality in our coastal wines. These unique conditions are ideal for growing cold-climate varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc.     VINTAGE NOTES     The 2013-2014 growing season was moderately warm, with low yields and lower than average rainfall in the winter months followed by a dry spring. Budbreak was delayed due to a cold spell in mid September. Cool growing conditions had the beneficial effect of the extended hang time and slow ripening of the grapes enabling them to preserve fresh character, aromatic intensity and beautiful mineral notes.     WINEMAKING NOTES     Grapes were hand picked in the early morning and carefully transported to the winery, where they are destemmed, crushed and pressed to best preserve their natural acidity. Juice is fermented in stainless steel tanks and aged on the lees for 3 months to enhance texture and volume in the palate.     TASTING NOTES     Juicy and lush with citrus aromas such as lime and grapefruit are complemented with floral notes. The palate is tense, with a notable acidity that is refreshing and nervy.

From 1988 to 1991 she was replaced by Sauvignon blanc. On-site studies and studies of the characteristics of this varietal have led to the conclusion that the orientation, height and lime content of the soil in the Voglar form a favorable condition for a good white wine.

Aromatics of gooseberry, lemongrass, and white pepper combined with smoky hints of flint and sea salt. Well-balanced with bright acid, the wine has tension and verve bringing length and energy, plus a slightly rounder mid-palate which carries delicate richness due to a small addition of Semillon.

The wine is fermented in a combination of stainless steel, concrete, and neutral barrels with partial malolactic fermentation. Aged for 6 months before filtration and bottling."

24788,Thomas Sancerre Mt Damnes,France,Thomas Sancerre,"Sauvignon Blanc, White Wine",13.0,"Chicken, Cheese - Fresh  Soft",Standard White Glass,45,Dry Wine,3,5.0,1,29.13,"From a plot of old vines in one of the greatest vineyards in Sancerre. Les Monts Damnes is hand harvested as the slope is far too steep for machine harvesting. Elevage is done in old foudres and the wine is bottled unfiltered. The resulting wine is sensational: rich, fat, round, with layered aromas, a subtle nose and a long finish. Not a typical bistro Sancerre, but a graceful wine meant for aging and pleasure.Years ago, we visited an old vigneron in Chavignol who had made fabulous Sancerre before his retirement: old-vines vineyards in Monts Damnés (Sancerre's greatest vineyard site), élevage in old foudres and unfiltered bottlings. We asked him who continued to work in that style and he said “Cotat and my friend Claude.” One thing led to another and we were off to meet Claude Thomas, who was busy pruning his vines in the rain. His wife dragged him into his cellar where he stripped off mud-caked boots and served us several vintages. Thomas was then 73, and wished to retire, but he was holding on in the hope that his daughter and son-in-law would take over. This finally happened when Jean-Paul Labaille, son-in-law, quit his civil servant job and became a full-time vigneron (for the previous ten vintages, he had taken his vacation during the harvest to be the assistant winemaker to Claude Thomas).Only minimal changes have occurred. The vineyards remain among the best in Chavignol, with a large proportion of old vines. The old barrels are not in use any more, but the vineyard and cellar work follow the same time-honored techniques. The Monts Damnés plot is too steep a slope to ever consider machine harvesting, which is now the norm in the appellation, and it requires intensive, non-mechanized vineyard work. But drainage and exposure are excellent and ensure the best ripeness for the vintage. Labaille has somewhat tidied up Thomas' facilities, which used to be in sharp contrast to most cellars in the area: instead of a hyper-hygienic room, with wall-to-wall tiled floors and stainless-steel vats, his was a Burgundian type of cellar. Some cuvées still age in large concrete vats, others in stainless-steel, and the oak barrels have been re-placed by newer ones, mostly second-hand, 2 to 3 years old, not in order to impart any oaky character to the wine, but to let it breathe and evolve slowly on its lees.The resulting wine is sensational: rich, fat, round, with layered aromas, a subtle nose and a long finish. Not a typical bistro Sancerre, but a graceful wine meant for ageing and pleasure."

Like the lobster, the soil in which the grapes for Meroi Sauvignon Colli Orientali del Friuli 2011 ($37) grow, a calcium-rich mudstone called ponca, was once beneath the ocean. The wine's minerality and acidity buoy seafoods and poultry, while its flowery aroma and herbaceous finish layer on complexity. Winemaker Damiano Meroi grows his grapes organically, presses them gently, and barrel-ages wines from different plots separately before blending. His family has been coddling their grapes for five generations, at times against tremendous odds: Forced to cook for Nazis occupying their small winery and restaurant during World War II, they built a fake wall in their cellar and hid their best bottles until the armistice."
